# Computer Vision Projects - Spatial Pyramid Matching For Scene Classification

Scene classification system/software that uses the bag-of-words approach with its spatial pyramid extension. Starts with the classic visual word dictionary approach, then implements a system that extracts deep features of an image for CNN (convolutional neural networks), and compares the two methods on a subset of the SUN database.
